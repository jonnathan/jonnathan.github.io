title: Jekyll Tutorials and Git
---

I wanted to blog about creating this mini blog. I found a great guide after following several tutorials and messing around in the command line, installing/configuring gems, and debugging runtime dependencies. Creating this blog is a great example of what coding is about: **A great exercise in problem solving.** I learned more every time that I failed to correctly deploy the site. I learned a great deal about:

* SSH Keys
* Markdown
* Configuring gems

 I hope my students understand the idea that in order to become great programmers, *developing a solution is just as important as the solution.* 

 I am also including this entry because I think it will be a great way for my students to practice with Git. 

Here's the [tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) to start blogging like a hacker. 

If you want other "themes", you should follow all the steps above; however, replace the repository you fork with [this](https://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll) or [that](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
