title: Happy Fourth of July!
---

The Flatiron 6/29 bootcamp came to and end. I had the pleasure of working with 19 outstanding teachers! I am now on my way to Austin and I can't wait to meet my students Monday. I know they are going to knock it out of the park every single day of their class. By the end of July, I know 40 students will be empowered and amazed at the endless possibilities the future holds.

In the meantime, celebrate America!
